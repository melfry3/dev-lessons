# Global Development Lessons & Patterns

This repository contains cross-project lessons learned, patterns, and best practices from development sessions with Claude Code.

## Files

- **lessons.md** - Documented mistakes, root causes, solutions, and patterns to prevent repeating errors
- **todo.md** - (Future) Global task tracking across projects
- **workflow.md** - (Future) Personal workflow orchestration rules

## Purpose

To maintain a persistent knowledge base that:
- Prevents repeating the same mistakes across projects
- Documents successful patterns and anti-patterns
- Provides context for future Claude Code sessions
- Syncs across multiple development machines

## Usage

Claude Code will:
1. Review `lessons.md` at the start of sessions
2. Update `lessons.md` after corrections or new patterns emerge
3. Reference these patterns when making architectural decisions

## Maintenance

- Update after any significant correction or learning
- Review periodically to remove outdated patterns
- Keep lessons project-agnostic and broadly applicable
